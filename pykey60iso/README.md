### How do I build it?

You don't need many tools to build it!  
* Press the switches through the top plate
* Align the key switch pins with their sockets and press them in, 
* Install the keycaps
* Install the adhesive rubber bump ons as feet.

### How do I program it?

PyKey60 can be programmed with CircuitPython.  To get started, get the latest download from the official [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) site, put the RP2040 in  booloader mode by pressing "reset" while pressing the "boot" button and drag/drop in the UF2 file you just downloaded. You are now ready to program it! No build tools required on your computer!

* Default Firmware for PyKey60 is based on the [MACROPAD Hoykeys](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys) example for the [Adafruit Macropad RP2040](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040) which is part of the [Adafruit Learning System Guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/), licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/LICENSE).
* Default firmware is **MIT** licensed.

### Hardware License

Design of PyKey60 is licensed under **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal**

1. () Have a README[.txt|.md] file describing which part is under which license this will help to quickly identify the project's license, particularly when several licenses are combined, or your are using libraries under other licenses. Also make sure the combination is allowed by the individual licenses.
2. (done) Include all full text licenses in a LICENSE[.txt] file
3. () Include a copyright notice in the schematic sheet(s), including author and date this will determine who the copyright holder is, and when the copyright will expire.
4. () Include the license name in the schematic sheet(s) this becomes important when different license are combined, and parts of the project, or libraries, are under different licenses
5. () Include all schematic symbols and board footprint libraries in the project without that the project can't be seen as complete. Also ensure their license is compatible.
66. () Export the schematic capture as pdf, and board layout as gerber+NC drill [and other fabrication output] files - not every user can, or wants, to install the EDA suite you are using. This is even more important if in the future this suite stops supporting the current format. If you don't want to mix the fabrication output with the source files, have a general project page pointing to the source files and fabrication output.
